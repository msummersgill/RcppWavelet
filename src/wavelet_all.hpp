/**
    @mainpage Wavelet - A library for online estimation of the Continuous Wavelet Transform
    @anchor mainpage
    @brief __wavelet__ is a cross-platform c++ library for online estimation of the
    Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). The online estimation is based on a filterbank
    implementation of the CWT with minimal delay per scale and optimization based on 
    multi-rate computation. The library also allows for offline estimation of the CWT using FFT.

    The following wavelets are currently implemented:
    - Complex Morlet Wavelet (also called Gabor wavelet)
    - Paul wavelet

    @par Dependencies & Compatibiliy
    The library uses a subset of c++11 functions.
    It depends on the open-source matrix library
    <a href="http://arma.sourceforge.net/">Armadillo</a> for linear algebra and FFT (only required for offline computation),
    <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a> (header-only), and
    <a href="https://github.com/philsquared/Catch">Catch</a> for unit-testing.
    
    @section download Download
    
    The source code is available on __Github__: https://github.com/Ircam-RnD/wavelet
    
    The online transform is also implemented as a <a href="http://ismm.ircam.fr/pipo/">PiPo</a>
    external for Cycling'74 Max.

    @tableofcontents

    @subsection dependencies Dependencies

    To compile the library, you need the following dependencies installed:
    - Boost headers: <a href="http://www.boost.org/">http://www.boost.org/</a>
    - [optional] Armadillo: <a href="http://arma.sourceforge.net/">http://arma.sourceforge.net/</a> (only required for offline computation)

    @subsection compiling Compiling as a static/dynamic library
    @par XCode

    See the xcode project in "ide/xcode/"

    @par CMake

    The library can be built using <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>.
    In the root directory, type the following command to generate the Makefiles:
    ```
    cmake . -G"Unix Makefiles"
    ```
    The following commands can be used to build the static library and run the unit tests, and generate the documentation:
    ```
    make
    make tests
    ```

    The following commands can be used to generate the developer documentation and the api documentation:
    ```
    make doc
    make docapi
    ```
    @par Usage

    The header file "wavelet_all.h" includes all useful headers of the library.

    @par Building

    The python module can be built using <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>.
    In the python directory, type the following command to generate the Makefiles and build the python module:
    ```
    cmake . -G"Unix Makefiles"
    make
    ```
    The module should be installed in "${wavelet_root}/python/bin/"
